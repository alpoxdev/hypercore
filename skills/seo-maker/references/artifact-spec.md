### Evidence and confidence fields

Every non-obvious finding should include:

- `evidence_grade`: `official`, `live`, `field`, `tool`, `lab`, `synthetic`, or `heuristic`.
- `confidence`: `high`, `medium`, or `low`.
- `measurement_method`: the scan, tool, probe, or source used to produce the finding.
- `source_tier`: `official-doc`, `observed-file`, `live-observation`, `field-data`, `tool-output`, `lab-result`, `synthetic-probe`, or `research-backed-heuristic`.

Use high confidence for official docs, direct file/header observations, or field data. Use lower confidence for local-only static scans, lab-only performance, synthetic AI prompt probes, and heuristic AEO/GEO advice.

### Measurement and platform fields

- `measurement_methods` records which evidence channels were available and how they affected confidence.
- `platform_policy` records search/AI crawler and snippet controls by platform or bot. Separate `OAI-SearchBot` search inclusion from `GPTBot` training policy. Conditional platform entries are target-gated: use `not-applicable` when the target is out of scope and `unknown` when the target applies but console, account, or live access is unavailable. When the target set includes Naver surfaces, record `naver_yeti`, `naver_nosourceinfo`, and `naver_feeds`. When it includes Bing surfaces, record `bing_indexnow` with the observed response code, the batch size, whether the key file was verified, and a quota source of `engine` or `unknown`; a receipt code is never recorded as index evidence and no quota number is estimated.
- `query_fanout` records generated subqueries and missing topical coverage.
- `citation_probe` records AI engine, prompt set, cited URLs, brand mentions, sample size, date, and confidence when run. If not run, store `status: "not-run"` and the reason.

### Optimize mode fields

When `mode` is `optimize` or the user asked for highest/max/perfect score, add these fields to `results.json`:

- `target_score` — optional user-defined or evaluator-defined goal; record its rationale and do not default to an arbitrary “perfect” threshold.
- `score_history[]` — ordered iteration log. Each item includes `iteration`, `score`, `grade`, `critical_count`, `decision`, `changed`, `evidence`, `evaluator_version`, `weights`, and `guard`.
- `best_run` — the highest-scoring kept iteration. Required before completion.
- `validator` — artifact-gated completion evidence, such as `{ "status": "passed" }` or an architect review verdict.
- `plateau` — optional object with `consecutive_iterations` and `reason` when completion is due to no further score gains.

Rules:

1. `score_history[0]` is always the baseline before changes.
2. Later scores are comparable only when the evaluator stayed stable. If scoring changes, record a reset event.
3. `best_run` must not point to a discarded iteration.
4. If code changes were made, validator evidence should include the relevant test/build/lint command output summary.
5. A higher rubric score is not sufficient when an indexing, correctness, accessibility, policy, or project guard regresses.
6. `unknown` and `not-applicable` categories never become numeric zeroes.
7. Every `score_history[]` entry records `evaluator_version` and `weights` (the category weights in canonical order). Scores are comparable only inside one evaluator version and weight set.
8. When `evaluator_version`, `weights`, or the category set changes, the first iteration under the new definition carries `decision: "reset"`. Do not report a score delta across a reset.
9. `best_run` must be the highest-scoring `kept` iteration, not merely a kept one.

### Status values

- `running` — audit in progress
- `idle` — waiting
- `complete` — audit complete

### Default category list

Seven default categories. Each category records `status: "measured" | "unknown" | "not-applicable"`, `score: 0..100 | null`, evidence, and confidence. The numeric rubric is an internal prioritization aid, not a Google or AI-platform ranking score.

1. Technical SEO
2. On-Page SEO
3. Content SEO
4. Core Web Vitals
5. Structured Data
6. AEO Readiness
7. GEO Readiness

### Finding ID rules

- `T1`, `T2`... — Technical SEO
- `O1`, `O2`... — On-Page SEO
- `C1`, `C2`... — Content SEO
- `W1`, `W2`... — Core Web Vitals
- `S1`, `S2`... — Structured Data
- `A1`, `A2`... — AEO Readiness
- `G1`, `G2`... — GEO Readiness

### Severity values

- `critical` — blocks indexing or severely harms ranking
- `warning` — degrades ranking or UX
- `info` — improvement opportunity

## `results.js`

Fallback for browsers where `fetch` does not work when opened via `file://`:

```javascript
window.__SEO_RESULTS__ = { /* same content as results.json */ };
```

`render-dashboard.mjs` writes this file from the same parsed `results.json` payload as `dashboard.html`, so it is generated output rather than a hand-maintained file. Re-run the renderer after `results.json` changes; hand edits are overwritten.

## `dashboard.html`

Copy it from `skills/seo-maker/assets/dashboard-template.html`.

Required behavior:

- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Read `results.json` (fall back to `results.js` for `file://`)
- Radar chart for seven category scores
- Severity distribution donut chart
- Category score bars
- Findings table with severity color coding
- Quick Wins table
- Prioritized Actions table
- Overall Grade display (A/B/C/D/F)

## `report.md`

Generate it from the existing `assets/report.template.md`. It is a Markdown rendering of the data in `results.json`.

## `flow.json`

Complex and optimize runs record phase state here. Minimal contract:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "resume_at": "onpage",
  "phases": [
    { "name": "scope", "status": "complete" },
    { "name": "measurement", "status": "complete" },
    { "name": "technical", "status": "complete" },
    { "name": "platform_policy", "status": "complete" },
    { "name": "onpage", "status": "running" },
    { "name": "content", "status": "pending" },
    { "name": "aeo", "status": "pending" },
    { "name": "geo", "status": "pending" },
    { "name": "report", "status": "pending" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Contract |
|-------|----------|
| `phases[].name` | canonical phase name, in the phase order below |
| `phases[].status` | `pending`, `running`, `complete`, or `skipped` |
| `resume_at` | `name` of the first phase whose `status` is not `complete`; a resumed run reads `flow.json` first and continues there |

Canonical phase order: `scope` → `measurement` → `technical` → `platform_policy` → `onpage` → `content` → `aeo` → `geo` → `report`. Keep this list identical to the phase order in `SKILL.md`.

## Lifecycle Rules

1. Create `.hyper/seo-maker/[slug]/` when the audit starts.
2. Set `status` in `results.json` to `running`.
3. Add findings to `results.json` as each phase completes.
4. After all phases finish, set `status` to `complete` and calculate `overall_grade`.
4-1. In Optimize mode, populate `score_history`, `best_run`, and `validator`, then record the evidence for the highest score or plateau.
5. Run `render-dashboard.mjs` to generate `dashboard.html` and `results.js`.
6. Write `report.md` and `sources.md` as well.
7. Open `dashboard.html` in a browser if the runtime is safe.

### Grade Calculation

The weighted formula is the only aggregation. Category scores come from the seven default categories in canonical order, and the weights come from the `<scoring>` block in `SKILL.md`.

```text
overall_score = Σ(category_score × category_weight) / Σ(category_weight)
```

| Rule | Contract |
|------|----------|
| Aggregation | `overall_score = Σ(score × weight) / Σ(weight)` over the included categories |
| Included categories | only `status: "measured"` categories count; `unknown` and `not-applicable` categories leave both the numerator and the denominator |
| Weights | the `<scoring>` weights in `SKILL.md`, applied in canonical category order |
| Recorded | included categories, weights, evaluator version, and evidence availability |
| Definition change | when the category set, weights, or evaluator version changes, start a new baseline and record a reset instead of reporting a delta |

Apply the thresholds below to the weighted score.

| Average | Grade |
|---------|-------|
| >= 90 | A |
| >= 75 | B |
| >= 60 | C |
| >= 40 | D |
| < 40 | F |

### Render Order

```bash
skills/seo-maker/scripts/render-dashboard.mjs .hyper/seo-maker/my-site
open .hyper/seo-maker/my-site/dashboard.html
```
