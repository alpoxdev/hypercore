# Remediation Workflow

## Modes

- `audit`: inspect, classify, and report. Never edit product source.
- `clean`: run an audit, apply supported low-risk changes, judge any structural change, verify, and report.
- `verify`: inspect an existing change against the brief, prior findings, and current guards. Do not broaden the change.

## Ordered procedure

1. Confirm target and mode from the request. A missing target blocks mutation.
2. Read project authority and available product/design context before scanning implementation details.
3. Write the brief inference and mark unknowns. Do not interpret missing `PRODUCT.md` or `DESIGN.md` as greenfield permission.
4. Run `detect-slop.mjs`; use `--baseline <result.json> --only-new` only for report-only delta comparison, never to approve debt. Optionally run `analyze-structure.mjs` when repeated page structure is relevant.
5. Collect rendered evidence only with an already available browser capability or validated handoff. Use project breakpoints or 375, 768, and 1280 widths. Inspect only relevant hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty, error, and reduced-motion states.
6. Classify every finding by engine, evidence kind, detection/remediation confidence, exception status, rule scope, severity, and evidence family. Select `remove`, `replace`, `preserve`, `ask`, or `block`.
7. In `clean`, apply the smallest low-risk category first. Do not combine unrelated redesigns into one pass.
8. Re-run the detector and affected project checks. Inspect rendered behavior where available.
9. Permit one correction pass only for a concrete failed guard. Stop after two total edit passes.
10. Report observed results and limitations using the template.

## Pass acceptance

Keep a pass only when all applicable conditions hold:

- no P0 remains
- each P1 is resolved or has a documented preservation reason
- no behavior regression is observed
- protected copy, IA, legal text, URLs, form contracts, assets, and brand commitments remain intact
- detector counts do not worsen without a justified trade-off
- no candidate exception, baseline, or waiver hides a protected-contract or P0 issue
- responsive and accessibility guards pass where they were actually checked
- the inferred or explicit brief is still satisfied

If a guard fails, discard or correct the specific change. Never redefine the baseline to make a pass look successful.
