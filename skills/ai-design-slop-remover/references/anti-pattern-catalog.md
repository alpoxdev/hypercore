# Anti-pattern Catalog

Load this catalog only when mapping detector output or a rendered observation to a rule. The registry is a judgment aid, not a universal ban list. `autofix` means a deterministic replacement may be safe only after the stated exception check.

| ID | Category | Scope | Default severity | Static | Autofix | Pattern and exception |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `surface.gradient-text` | surface | default-risk | P2 | yes | no | Gradient-clipped headline; preserve explicit brand/reference typography |

## Registry interpretation

Static `yes` means the bundled detector can find a source signature, not that the UI is defective. `partial` means source heuristics need context or rendering. Browser-only and subjective patterns remain reportable only with an explicit warrant and caveat. For remediation steps, load `fix-playbook.md`.

Detector v2 reports `engine`, `evidenceKind`, detection/remediation confidence, cluster, and exception status. A `candidate` exception remains a visible review item; it does not suppress a finding or authorize automatic removal.
