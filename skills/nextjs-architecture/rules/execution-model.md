# Execution Model

> Next.js Server and Client Component boundary rules.

---

## Core Rule

Do not guess where code runs.

- Server Components are the default in App Router.
- Client Components need `'use client'` at entry-point files that are rendered from Server Components.
- Once a file is marked `'use client'`, its imports and child components become part of the client module graph.
- Client Components can be prerendered, so they must still avoid server secrets and server-only APIs.
- Server-only code must stay out of the client environment.

## Default Strategy

1. Start with a Server Component.
2. Add `'use client'` only for state, event handlers, effects, browser APIs, or client-only hooks.
3. Keep the client boundary as low as possible in the tree.
4. Pass only serializable, minimal props from server to client.
5. Keep privileged reads in server-only modules or a DAL.

## Hard Rules

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| Interactive code without `'use client'` | BLOCKED |
| High-level layout or root marked `'use client'` without real need | BLOCKED |
| Client Component imports DB clients, secret env, `cookies()`, `headers()`, or server-only helpers | BLOCKED |
| Non-serializable or broad raw records passed from Server Components to Client Components | BLOCKED |
| Server-only helper lacks `import 'server-only'` or equivalent boundary clarity | WARNING |
| Provider rendered broader than needed | WARNING. Render providers as deep as possible |

## Serializable Props Rule

Props passed from Server Components to Client Components must be serializable and intentionally small.

Prefer:

- DTOs
- small view models
- explicit primitive props
- IDs that let a Client Component call an approved action or route when client refresh is truly needed

Avoid:

- whole ORM records
- class instances, functions, symbols, or non-serializable values
- secrets
- internal fields the UI does not need

## Provider Placement

Context providers should wrap only the subtree that needs them. This preserves more of the tree for static optimization and keeps client bundles smaller.

## Server-Only and Client-Only Protection

Use `import 'server-only'` for modules that must never run in the client environment:

- DAL modules
- DB access
- secret-bearing SDK wrappers
- authorization helpers that must stay server-side

Use client-only wrappers for browser-dependent third-party components that do not expose a compatible client entry point.

## Review Checklist

- `'use client'` appears only where needed
- Client Components do not reach server-only modules
- Props crossing the server/client boundary are narrow and serializable
- Providers are placed as deep as practical
- Third-party browser-only UI is wrapped behind a clear Client Component boundary
