## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Phase not yet started |
| `in_progress` | Phase currently active |
| `completed` | Phase finished successfully |
| `failed` | Phase failed (verify only) |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external input (overall status only) |

## Rules

- Set `current_phase` to the first phase with status `in_progress` or `pending`.
- Update `updated_at` on every write.
- When all phases are `completed`, set top-level `status` to `completed`.
- If `verify` fails, set its status to `failed` and fix within scope before retrying.
- Before resume, require `skill: deploy-fix`, `complexity: complex`, a matching current request/scope/target, valid phase statuses, and a non-completed top-level status. Treat malformed, stale, cross-workspace, conflicting, or completed state as non-resumable until reconciled.
- Never inherit user confirmation or external-action permission from a previous or interrupted flow. Reconfirm before `fix` when selection is ambiguous and before every remote/production action.
- Allow at most three materially different failed repair approaches. After the third failure, set top-level `status` to `blocked`, preserve attempt evidence, and stop for one precise input.
- The `id` uses the creation timestamp: `deploy-fix-20260327-100000`.

## Example: initial state

  "updated_at": "2026-03-27T15:00:00Z",
  "request": {
    "failure": "TypeScript compilation error: Cannot find module '@repo/shared'",
    "scope": "workspace:apps/web",
    "build_command": "turbo build --filter=apps/web",
    "ci_provider": "GitHub Actions",
    "related_files": ["apps/web/tsconfig.json", "packages/shared/package.json"]
  },
  "current_phase": "investigate",
  "phases": {
