# Pre-Deploy Skill

> Cross-stack pre-deploy validation and remediation for node/rust/python.

Use this skill only when the current repository root contains a supported stack marker such as `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, or `poetry.lock`.

If no supported stack is detected from the repository root, stop immediately and report that `pre-deploy` does not apply instead of pretending the checks ran.

<scripts>

## Available scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `scripts/stack-detect.sh` | Detect project stacks (`node`, `rust`, `python`) |
| `scripts/deploy-check.sh` | Full verification (`lint/type checks + build`) |
| `scripts/lint-check.sh` | Run stack-specific quality checks |
| `scripts/build-run.sh` | Run stack-specific build phase |
| `scripts/pm-detect.sh` | Node package manager detection (`npm/yarn/pnpm/bun`) |

</scripts>

<workflow>

## Workflow

### Full validation (recommended)

```bash
scripts/deploy-check.sh
```

Run the scripts from the repository root. The helper scripts detect stacks and package managers relative to the current working directory.

### Step-by-step validation

```bash
# 1) quality checks
scripts/lint-check.sh

# 2) build phase
scripts/build-run.sh
```

### Stack behavior summary

- **Node.js**: typecheck/lint (if configured) + build script (if configured)
- **Rust**: `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy` + `cargo check` + `cargo build --release`
- **Python**: lint (`ruff`/`flake8` if available) + type/syntax check (`mypy` or `compileall`) + build (`poetry build` or `python -m build`, fallback `compileall`)
- **Unsupported repository**: stop immediately with the detected unsupported-stack error and do not continue into a fake fix loop

<required>

| Category | Required |
|------|------|
| **Thinking** | Use Sequential Thinking (3-5 steps per issue) |
| **Tracking** | Track failures with TodoWrite |
| **Strategy** | Run stack checks -> fix sequentially -> rerun checks -> run build |
| **Validation** | Re-check affected targets after each edit |
| **Completion** | Confirm deploy-check passes before completion |

</required>

<execution_plan>

1. Run `scripts/deploy-check.sh`
2. Convert errors into TodoWrite items by stack and priority
3. For each issue:
   - Run sequential-thinking
   - Apply focused fix
   - Re-run relevant check
4. Re-run full deploy check
5. Report final status and remaining risks

Do not skip step 1. `deploy-check.sh` is the entrypoint because it proves both the quality phase and the build phase from the same repository root.
