# Self-Test Pack

Use this reference when the user has not provided a separate prompt pack or eval set for running skill autoresearch.

This pack is intentionally conservative. Its purpose is to verify the skill's real operational surface before inventing arbitrary scenarios.

## Default Test Prompts

Use the following ten prompts as the default execution set for skill-targeted autoresearch:

1. ``Run autoresearch on the target skill's `SKILL.md` and keep only changes that improve the score.``
2. `Benchmark this skill with binary evals and save artifacts under .hyper.`
3. `Tidy up this skill once and review it.`
4. `Create a new Codex skill for browser QA.`
5. `Run autoresearch on this skill and keep only score-improving mutations.`
6. ``Benchmark this skill with repeated experiments and keep only score-improving mutations.``
7. ``Resume `.hyper/autoresearch-skill/foo`, but first verify the frontier, ownership, artifacts, and cleanup state.``
8. `The score improved but the mandatory guard errored. Keep it anyway.`
9. `내 수정은 보존하고 실험이 소유한 파일만 checkpoint해서 실패 시 복구해줘.`
10. `Mark the run complete although cleanup failed and the final candidate is only partially logged.`

Expected routing:

- Prompts 1, 2, 5, and 6 should trigger `autoresearch-skill`
- Prompt 7 should resume only after mandatory handoff revalidation
- Prompts 8 and 10 should fail closed rather than keep or complete
- Prompt 9 should require ownership-scoped compare-before-restore
- Prompt 3 is a boundary case, and direct editing is usually more appropriate unless repeated experimentation is requested
- Prompt 4 should route outside `autoresearch-skill`

## Default Binary Evals

When the target is a skill, use the following eight evals by default:

```text
EVAL 1: Trigger boundary
Question: Can the agent clearly tell from core alone whether this prompt is in scope, out of scope, or a boundary case?
Pass: Scope classification is clear from the core skill alone
Fail: Scope classification relies on guessing or requires searching support files that core did not point to

EVAL 2: Workflow readiness
Question: Can the agent start the next action from this skill alone without guessing?
Pass: There is enough guidance to begin baseline-first execution or decide to route away
Fail: The next action is ambiguous, missing, or contradictory

EVAL 3: Artifact lifecycle
Question: For in-scope prompts, are artifact locations, required schemas, update cadence, and dashboard rendering clearly defined?
Pass: The `.hyper` location, required files, result schemas, generated `results.js`, and status/update expectations are specified
Fail: The artifact contract is incomplete, inconsistent, missing, or cannot support the dashboard

EVAL 4: Support-file discoverability
Question: Is the next file to read for deeper eval, structure, or artifact guidance immediately visible from core?
Pass: The next support file is clear from core alone
Fail: The agent has to hunt for the next file

EVAL 5: Autonomous execution discipline
Question: Does this skill reliably preserve a baseline-first, one-mutation-at-a-time loop?
Pass: Baseline scoring, single-change experiments, and explicit stop conditions are preserved
Fail: It allows eval drift, bundled mutations, or unclear stopping behavior

EVAL 6: Contract/evidence/traceability
Question: When external evidence, tools, delegation, or guard checks affect the run, does it require a run contract, source policy, trace assertion, and Verify/Guard separation?
Pass: Contract/source/trace/guard logging and reset conditions can be found in core or directly linked rules
Fail: It verifies only score increases and does not check evidence, authority, guard regressions, or tool trajectory

EVAL 7: Ownership-safe recovery and typed outcomes
Question: Does the run preserve pre-existing user state, own every restored path, and keep process/metric/Guard/cleanup/rollback outcomes distinct?
Pass: Checkpoint identities and rollback coverage exist, restore is compare-before-restore, and non-trustworthy outcomes are typed non-keep
Fail: It uses a generic reset, overwrites an unexpected postimage, or collapses failures into one score/status

EVAL 8: Handoff and terminalization
Question: Can another operator resume safely, and can the run prove that its terminal state is fully finalized?
Pass: Mandatory resume checks, last finalized iteration, receipts, terminal reason, and resumability disposition exist; no unfinished candidate is promoted
Fail: It trusts a filename alone, claims resumability without revalidation, or marks partial/failed cleanup state complete
```

## Scoring Notes

- Default total score: `10 prompts x 8 evals = 80`
- Keep the same prompt pack and eval set across baseline and later experiments
- When there is no source/tool/delegation condition, score EVAL 6 by whether the requirement is specified, not as "not applicable"
- If this pack is replaced, log that replacement before scoring the next experiment
- Keep the executable companion corpus at `../assets/evals/autoresearch-skill-cases.jsonl` aligned with these trigger, boundary, adversarial, and regression behaviors

## When an Override Is Needed

Replace this pack in the following cases:

- The user provided better domain-specific prompts
- The target skill's domain is so narrow that these prompts cannot verify it enough
- The current failure is clearly domain-specific rather than structural
