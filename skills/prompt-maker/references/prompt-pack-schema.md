# Prompt Pack Schema

Use this schema for reusable prompt artifacts. Keep keys stable when an eval harness or downstream script reads them.

```yaml

```

## Required Sections

Every prompt pack should include identity, variables, context packet, examples, constraints, output schema, eval cases, and version note even when some values are intentionally empty with a reason.

When `format` is `json` or `yaml`, define exact key names and types, reject malformed required inputs, and include a schema eval that parses the output. Do not accept prose that merely mentions the required fields.
