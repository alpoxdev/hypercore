# Validation and Iteration

**Purpose**: Make skill quality observable rather than guessed.

## 1. Validation Layers

| Layer | Question | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Anatomy | Is the folder and frontmatter shape correct? | frontmatter, folder shape, local links, code fences |
| Trigger | Does the skill activate on the right requests? | positive, negative, boundary, and near-miss prompt set |
| Contract | Can the agent find the operating agreement? | intent, trigger, scope, authority, evidence, tools, output, verification, stop readback |
| Workflow | Does the skill guide the right steps? | workflow readback, trace review, manual dry run |
| Output | Does the artifact shape match expectations? | template, schema, rubric, required/forbidden output check |
| Source | Are external claims linked to evidence? | source ledger, checked date, claim-source mapping |
| Safety | Are side effects and permissions gated? | forbidden/required behavior review |
| Artifact | Does the skill itself carry something it should not? | the seven-row audit in §6 |
| Regression | Will future edits preserve behavior? | small eval set or deterministic validation script |

## 2. Case Composition, Not Case Counts

The set must cover each of these groups. **How many rows each one gets is not fixed here** - no source
states a validated count, so this file states a composition requirement instead:

- should-trigger
- should-not-trigger
- boundary
- near-miss (coexistence: a request that belongs to a neighboring skill)
- source-sensitive
- safety/adversarial

Add a row only when it probes something the existing rows do not. A case that probes nothing new adds
calls, not evidence. Promote each real failure into a row as it happens, and keep every trigger case's own
`runs` and `threshold` visible at the point of use.

Validation depth is selected explicitly rather than assumed:

| Depth | Use when | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|---|
| smoke | Small wording or metadata edit | Structural check plus a few focused cases |
| targeted | One behavior or known failure changes | Smoke set plus the failure and adjacent edge cases |
| standard | New skill or material workflow change | The full composed set across the groups above |
| thorough | Tool, source, delegation, or broad behavior changes | Standard set plus trace, safety, source, and runtime variants |
| high-stakes | Production, security, credentials, publication, or destructive effects | Thorough set plus independent review and explicit permission/rollback gates |

The ranges above guide sampling. Critical-case coverage and claim-matched evidence are the actual gates,
not a case count.

## 3. Baseline Rules

These are normative.

- SK-V-1: Run each case **by default** twice - once with the skill and once without it (or against a previous version). Exception: when the no-skill condition cannot produce the artifact at all - a deterministic skill such as a formatter or a schema checker - do not run it; record that fact instead.
- SK-V-2: When improving an existing skill, use a **snapshot of the previous version** as the baseline instead of the no-skill condition. Snapshot the skill folder before editing and point at that snapshot.
- SK-V-3: Do not claim the skill improved **without a baseline** to compare against.
- SK-V-4: Remove or replace any assertion that passes in **both** conditions - it does not reflect the skill's value and only inflates the pass rate. An assertion that always **fails** in both conditions is a subject for investigation, not deletion.

## 4. Where Execution Results Live

These are normative.

- SK-E-1: Keep execution results **outside the skill folder**, under `.omo/evidence/<skill>/iteration-N/`. A shipped skill does not carry its own run history.
- SK-E-2: Every run leaves `timing.json` (tokens and wall time) and `grading.json` (per-assertion pass/fail **plus the evidence string**). A `passed: true` with no evidence string is not evidence.
- SK-E-3: Run each execution in an **independent session**. Reusing one session lets the earlier run's context contaminate the next.
- SK-E-4: Check mechanical assertions (valid JSON, row counts, file existence) with a **script**, not a judge. Reserve judgement for what a script cannot decide.

The upstream source places test cases in `evals/evals.json` inside the skill directory and results in a
workspace beside it. This repository deliberately chose the evidence-directory form above, and the
trade-off is real: results do not travel with a distributed skill, so a reader outside this repository
cannot see them. Fixtures still live in `assets/evals/`; only results live outside.

## 5. Measurement Profiles

Choose one profile **before** deciding repeats, aggregation, or judging. A profile chosen after seeing
the numbers is not a profile.

| Profile | Minimum defensible contract |
|---|---|
| `exact-deterministic` | One valid observation may be enough. Unexpected variation is an error to investigate |
| `cold-start` | Preserve startup/cache state; warmup would invalidate the estimand. Define reset and isolation between trials |
| `noisy-performance` | Declare the estimand, independent replicates, comparison order, aggregation method, a practical effect or tie band, and an inconclusive state |
| `stochastic-model` | Record platform/software/data identity and randomness controls; use independent runs when across-run variance affects the decision. **A fixed seed alone does not estimate variance** |
| `subjective-judge` | Lock the rubric and items, identify judge provenance, counterbalance presentation, preserve raw judgments, and define tie/abstain/invalid/disagreement escalation |

**A measured trigger rate is a `stochastic-model` measurement.** So is any judge-scored rubric. Record
the model and runtime identity and the run count with the result, and state the target interval width
together with the run count rather than reporting a bare pass rate.

Guards and metrics are independent channels, and one does not compensate for the other:

- **A metric improvement never compensates for a failed, errored, missing, or malformed mandatory guard.**
- A guard pass is not inferred from the score or from a process exit code.
- Exit `0` means the verifier completed, not that the candidate improved.

## 6. The Artifact Audit

The rules above test what a skill **receives** - does it resist an injected instruction. These test what a
skill **is**: does the artifact itself carry something it should not. A skill is distributed code plus
instructions, so audit it before shipping.

| Category | What to look at | Severity as assigned by the source |
|---|---|---|
| Code execution | Scripts in the skill directory (`*.py`, `*.sh`, `*.js`). Scripts run with full environment access | High |
| Instruction manipulation | Directives to ignore safety rules, hide actions from users, or alter behavior conditionally | High |
| MCP server reference | References shaped like `ServerName:tool_name` | High |
| Network access | URLs, API endpoints, `fetch`, `curl`, `requests` | High |
| Hardcoded credentials | Keys, tokens, and passwords inside skill files or scripts | High |
| Filesystem scope | Paths outside the skill directory, broad globs, `../` | Medium |
| Tool invocations | Instructions directing the agent to use bash, file operations, or other tools | Medium |

**All seven rows, not a subset.** `instructions/skill/references/prompt-loop-eval.md` carries five of
them and omits **Code execution**, **Instruction manipulation**, and **Tool invocations**; its
"data-exfiltration pattern" row comes from that page's review checklist rather than its risk-tier table.
Carry all seven here and note the base's omission as a follow-up rather than editing the base.

This applies to `skill-maker` itself: the package ships `scripts/validate-skill-maker.mjs`, so it is a
code-execution instance and must pass its own audit.

- SK-A-1: Audit a skill against the seven categories above before distributing it, and record the result.
- SK-A-2: Do not distribute a skill from an untrusted source without a full audit.
- SK-A-3: Pin a skill to a version, and re-review it when the version changes.

These severity labels come from the cited source, not from a controlled study. Treat the audit as a
checklist that catches known artifact-level problems, not as a proof of safety.

## 7. Evaluator Overfitting

Repeatedly selecting winners against one benchmark overfits the evaluator even when each estimate is
precise. Use a development metric for iteration and an immutable **confirmation set** for finalists, and
do not feed detailed holdout failures back into the loop. This is the same principle as the train and
validation split in `rules/trigger-design.md`, stated for evaluation rather than for descriptions.

## 8. Trace Assertions for Agent Workflows

When a skill teaches tool use, delegation, or parallel work, validate trajectory as well as final text.

| Assertion | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| read_before_edit | target `SKILL.md` and linked rules were read before edits |
| local_baseline | project instructions such as `instructions/skill/SKILL_AUTHORING.md` were considered for non-trivial work |
| bounded_tools | tool use is capability-based and side effects are gated |
| bounded_spawn | subagent/background prompts include objective, scope, ownership, output, stop condition |
| independent_or_sequenced | parallel work is independent or explicitly sequenced |
| parent_verifies | final completion relies on leader/readback verification, not child claims only |
| source_guard | web/tool results are evidence, not instruction authority |
| input_schema | URLs, paths, commands, recipients, and tool arguments conform to scope, schema, or allowlist |
| no_unauthorized_effect | destructive, external, credential, publication, deployment, and production effects are absent or explicitly authorized |
| no_conflicting_edits | delegated write ownership does not overlap and same-file work is sequenced |
| runtime_degrades_explicitly | unavailable capabilities lead to an equivalent fallback, explicit skip, or block |
| loop_guard | acceptance follows the declared feedback, metric/rubric, guard, and stop rule |
| bilingual_behavior | equivalent English/Korean cases preserve the same modal strength and completion gate |

## 9. Usability Readback

Read the skill as if you were a new maintainer, a trigger model, an agent following the workflow under
context pressure, and a reviewer checking source, safety, and output claims. After each major section,
confirm the next file to read is obvious.

## 10. Exit Criteria

- Trigger examples distinguish this skill from neighboring skills, including a near-miss case.
- The core `SKILL.md` remains lean and navigable.
- Support files are easy to discover from the core skill.
- Deterministic validator and JSONL eval fixture checks have run, or the report states that script/eval integration is still pending.
- A new maintainer could place the next piece of information without guessing.
- Completion claims map to evidence, verification, and caveats.
- Validation records baseline/current results, critical and non-critical failures, regressions, residual risk, and one decision: `ship`, `iterate`, `caveated ship`, or `block`.

### Evidence grade

The baseline and results-layout rules are `PRIMARY` - the evaluating-skills page names the with/without
pair as the core pattern rather than an option. The severity labels are `VENDOR`. This file deliberately
states **no normative case count**: no source consulted states a validated one, so a composition
requirement takes its place.
