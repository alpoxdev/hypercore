# Commit And Push Policy

Use this rule when `git-maker` is active and you need the durable commit/push contract after the fast inspection pass.

## Argument Modes

| Input | Action |
|------|------|
| no argument | Same as `current`: select only changes attributable to the current session, verify against Git state, group into logical commits, then push. Do not fall back to unrelated remaining changes. |
| `current` or `CURRENT` | Explicit current-session mode. Use the session's edit/tool record plus diff evidence to select only files or hunks this session created. If attribution is ambiguous, exclude the change and report it rather than absorbing user or other-agent work. |
| `ALL` or `all` | Include every uncommitted file, group into logical commits, and leave no file behind. |
| `--force` | Remove `--force` from commit arguments and pass it only to the push phase, which must use `--force-with-lease` and still block `main`/`master`. |
| `&& <branch>` | End commit arguments and append one propagation target. Multiple targets run left-to-right after the source branch is committed and pushed. Scope keywords are case-insensitive. |
| other argument | Treat it as a filter for repo discovery, file selection, staging, and message generation. Stop if it does not match actual git state. |

## Current-Session Attribution

- Prefer exact files and hunks written through the current session's tools and verified in the live diff.
- A file touched by this session is not wholly owned by it: split-stage only attributable hunks when pre-existing or concurrent edits share the file.
- Never infer ownership merely because a change is unstaged, recent, or the only remaining dirty change.
- If exact hunk separation cannot be performed safely, leave the ambiguous file uncommitted and report it. `ALL` is the explicit opt-in for absorbing every uncommitted change.

## Commit Rules

| Category | Rule |
|------|------|
| Inspect first | Run a status/preflight command before staging or committing. |
| Diff source | If staged changes exist, treat staged files as the default candidate and inspect staged diff. If nothing is staged, inspect unstaged/untracked changes. |
| Repository boundary | Multiple repositories must be committed independently. Never stage or commit from a non-repository parent as if nested repos were one repo. In linked Git worktrees, use the checkout root from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` as the boundary; do not collapse it to the shared `git-common-dir`. |
| Logical scope | Each commit covers exactly one logical change. Commit multiple groups sequentially. |
| Staging discipline | Stage only files required for the selected group. Do not use blanket staging unless `ALL` mode truly includes every uncommitted file and grouping still happens per logical unit. |
| Type selection | Choose the Conventional Commit type from the actual dominant change. |
| Scope selection | Use scope only when one module/package/feature clearly owns the change. |
| Language | Commit subject and body are Korean; Conventional Commit type/scope remain English. |
| Subject line | Use neutral Conventional Commit result/summary wording, not Korean command/imperative endings; lowercase after colon, under 72 characters. |
| Body/footer | Add only when needed for why/risk/follow-up, breaking change, verified issue references, or explicitly requested metadata. |
| Safety | Never commit secrets, generated credentials, or unrelated user changes. Never use `--no-verify`, rebase, reset, amend, or destructive history operations unless explicitly requested. |
| Hook failures | Inspect the error. Fix and retry only if the current change caused it and the fix is safe; otherwise stop and report the blocker. |

## Commit Message Tone

Write the Korean subject as a commit-message summary, not as an instruction to the reader.

| Use | Avoid | Why |
|------|------|------|
| `build(deps): align build paths with stable toolchain versions` | `build(deps): make the build paths use stable toolchain versions` | The avoided form reads like an instruction. |
| `build(cloudflare): stabilize Workers deployment path` | `build(cloudflare): stabilize the Workers deployment path now` | The avoided form reads like an imperative order. |
| `refactor(nextjs): secure deploy stability with stronger architecture boundaries` | `refactor(nextjs): force architecture boundaries to secure deploy stability` | Commit subjects should describe the change/result. |

Preferred Korean subject shapes:

- noun/result phrase, such as "build path alignment", "deployment path stabilization", or "validation flow improvement"
- concise past-effect/result summary, such as "dependency resolution pinned" or "routing boundary separated"
- no sentence-final Korean command endings or direct orders to future maintainers

If the natural draft reads like a command, rewrite it to the result now present in the commit.

## Grouping Heuristics

1. Files that implement the same feature or fix belong together.
2. Tests belong with corresponding implementation files.
3. Config/build changes belong with the feature they support.
4. Unrelated standalone changes each form their own group.
5. In `ALL` mode, every uncommitted file must appear in exactly one group.

## Push Rules

| Category | Rule |
|------|------|
| Commit first | All commit groups must succeed before any push. |
| No confirmation | Do not ask whether to push after successful commits; push automatically. |
| Explicit repos | Prefer passing the repo list from `scripts/git-maker-fast.mjs inspect` into `scripts/git-maker-fast.mjs push` to avoid duplicate discovery. |
| Worktrees | Linked worktrees are valid push targets when on a named branch; pass their checkout root paths, not `.git/worktrees/...` or the common git dir. |
| Upstream | If no upstream exists, push with `-u origin <branch>`. |
| Safety | Never force push to `main` or `master`. Never push from detached HEAD. |
| Failure | If push fails, report failed repos. Commits remain local; do not pretend the operation completed. |

## Multi-Branch Propagation

1. Parse and validate every `&&` target before mutation. Reject empty/duplicate targets, the source branch, detached HEAD, and invalid ref names.
2. Capture the ordered commit list created by this run. Never propagate unrelated earlier commits merely because they are ahead locally.
3. Use a clean existing linked worktree or create a temporary linked worktree per target. Do not switch a dirty source checkout or disturb unrelated worktree state.
4. Fetch and fast-forward the target from its configured remote before applying commits. Do not merge the whole source branch or rewrite target history.
5. Cherry-pick the captured commits in order. This is the application mechanism; conflict resolution may merge the intentional source and target behaviors in the resulting files.
6. Push a target only after its cherry-pick sequence and relevant validation succeed. Then continue to the next target.
7. Remove only temporary worktrees created by this run and only after they are clean. Never remove a user's pre-existing worktree.

## Conflict Resolution And Escalation

On conflict, own the resolution by default:

- inspect all conflict stages (`base`, `ours`, `theirs`), the source commit intent, target-branch evolution, relevant callers, and tests
- preserve non-conflicting target changes and integrate the source behavior rather than choosing a side wholesale
- resolve generated artifacts through their canonical generator when available; do not hand-edit generated output as the primary fix
- run focused type/lint/tests or the affected executable surface before continuing and pushing
- document what was reconciled in the final report

Ask the user one narrow outcome question only if at least one material decision remains: two or more plausible product behaviors, incompatible schema/data migrations, security or deployment policy ambiguity, deletion of intentional target functionality, or a redesign whose scope substantially exceeds the propagated commits. File count alone is not a blocker, but a wide conflict is evidence to reassess scope. If asking, stop before later targets and preserve a recoverable cherry-pick/worktree state with exact commands and paths reported.

## Type Selection

| Observed dominant change | Type |
|------|------|
| user-facing capability added | `feat` |
| incorrect behavior fixed | `fix` |
| docs only | `docs` |
| formatting/style only | `style` |
| internal restructure | `refactor` |
| performance improvement | `perf` |
| tests added/updated | `test` |
| build/dependency/tooling | `build` |
| CI automation | `ci` |
| maintenance/metadata | `chore` |
| revert | `revert` |

## Failure Handling

| Failure case | Response |
|------|------|
| candidate filter does not match git state | stop; do not push |
| no changes to commit | report no commit was created; push only if there are already unpushed commits and user intent still includes push |
| one commit group fails | stop; do not push any later groups |
| push fails | report which repositories failed; local commits remain safe |
| propagation conflict with one coherent intent-preserving result | resolve, validate, continue, and report the reconciliation |
| propagation conflict requires a material behavior/architecture decision | ask one focused question; do not begin later targets |
| network/auth prompt risk | use non-interactive push helper output; report remote/auth blocker if push cannot proceed |
