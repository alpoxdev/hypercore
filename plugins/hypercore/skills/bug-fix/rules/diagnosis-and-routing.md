# Diagnosis and Routing Rules

Use this rule before classifying a bug or deciding whether to edit immediately.

## 1. Intake minimum

Proceed when at least one of these is available:

- exact error message, stack trace, or failing test name
- expected vs actual behavior
- reproduction steps, URL, command, or interaction path
- related file, component, route, API endpoint, or recent local diff

If none is available, ask one concise clarifying question and stop.

## 2. Evidence ladder

Prefer stronger evidence before weaker evidence:

1. failing test or reproduction command observed locally
2. direct runtime/log output from the user or local environment
3. source-level invariant violation or type/control-flow proof
4. recent local diff that explains the symptom
5. plausible hypothesis without reproduction

Do not implement from level 5 alone. Use it to guide investigation.

## 3. Complexity classification

Classify as **simple** only when all are true:

- one failing boundary is clear
- likely changed files are narrow
- one fix path is obviously safest
- side effects are local and reversible
- validation can be targeted

Classify as **complex** when any are true:

- multiple root-cause hypotheses remain plausible
- more than one valid fix strategy has meaningful tradeoffs
- the bug crosses modules, services, data model, auth, persistence, or external integration boundaries
- the fix might change public behavior, schema, contracts, or user-visible flow beyond the symptom
- reproduction is partial but impact is high

When uncertain, choose complex and track the investigation.

## 4. Mode selection

| Mode | Use when | Edit allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnose-only | User asks for analysis only, or evidence is insufficient for safe edits | No |
| Fix-now | Simple classification, explicit fix request, evidenced root cause, one safe path | Yes |
| Option-first | Complex classification or meaningful repair tradeoffs | Only after user selection |
| Handoff | Primary issue is build/CI/deploy/security/feature/design/doc work | No, unless handoff workflow owns it |

## 5. Confirmation gates

Ask for user selection before editing when:

- there are multiple viable fixes with different product or compatibility outcomes
- the fix could remove data, change schema, affect auth/security, or alter public API behavior
- validation requires unavailable credentials, paid services, production systems, or destructive setup
- the user explicitly requested options first

Do not ask for confirmation just to do an obvious low-risk direct bug fix.
